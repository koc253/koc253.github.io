<p class="first">FL studio has a far superior piano roll mode, with much more intuitive controls. FL can also support 32 and 64 bit plugins natively, in Ableton you need to use a third party tool 'jbridge' to get your 32 bit plugs into 64 bit Ableton. Ableton is far superior for live recording, as well as audio manipulation, since you can resample on the spot, freeze and edit duplicated samples much faster, as well as consolidate audio and midi clips far more efficiently.All that being said, ultimately it's down to your own skill level with each DAW, as it's not the software that makes good music, it's the artists skills.  </p>

<h2 class="second"> CONS </h2>
    
<div id="intro">
    
<p class="second">Workflow is very different than traditional DAWs. Someone coming from the world of Pro Tools is going to have a rough transition. Plugin management is confusing. Odd ASIO performance. A lot of times it's trial and error. For example, a "decent" Focusrite 18i20 gets better latency than an "exceptional" RME Fireface UFX+. In any other software, the RME gets 2-3x better performance than the Focusrite. In FL, for some reason, it buffers out under 10ms. No audio quantization. Cubase, Logic, Pro Tools, Nuendo, Presonus Studio, etc can all detect transients and "time correct" recorded audio. Newtone is a step in the right direction, but it's certainly not usable for time correction on a quality level.Video integration, while improved, leaves a bit to be desired. I still use it when scoring to picture though. </p>
