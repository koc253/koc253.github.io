<h2 class="second"> Current State of the DAW Market </h2>
 
    
<div id="intro">
<p class="second">  <strong>DAWs are digital audio workstations that many producers and musicians use to create their sound.  </strong> There are multiple options for those who are seeking a DAW to make their music on. FL Studio seems to be addressed to newbies, although some good tracks came out from this DAW (most famous example is Levels from Avicii). It’s possible to record instruments and vocals but the process is a bit long and tricky. Fl Studio is more about composing and using its (pretty good) piano roll. If you are just starting out I think your best bet is to start with only one.  <strong> Don’t overwhelm yourself.  </strong> Logic, on the other hand, is a station for those in search of versatility, yet it comes with a price. Choose the DAW that attracts you the most as long as you have enough tutorials to learn the beast. My recommendation would be checking out Pro Tools and Ableton before making any decision. It depends if you use a Mac or a PC. FL studio is more user-friendly with PCs although it’s now compatible with Mac. </p>

<h2> My Personal Experience </h2>

<div id="intro">
<p class="first">I began using FL studio a couple of years ago. Ive recently gotten a Macbook Pro and moved over to Logic pro 9. In terms of ease of use, Logic seems alot better than FL because you use the tracks on which you record to fix your levels and input fx, rather than constantly opening and closing the mixer in FL. Logic comes with various plugins (fx/synths) and is also compatible with the fx and jam packs which come with garageband previously installed on mac computers. The one big downside is that the sequencing element is very different from the usual, but still easy to use.  </p>
