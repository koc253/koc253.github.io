<p class="first">There're high quality instruments and effects preloaded, Good range of high quality synths: analog, FM, wavetable, string modulation, sampler, organ, clarinet, e-piano. The Fl studio also comes with preloaded plugins which may not be as high grade as Apple Logic X but it all comes to the type of plugins you use. Use the NI Kontakt and you have got some amazing high quality samples. Use Nexus and Sylenth1 to get the best sounding Electronic Synth sounds.Logic Comes with 32gb content, the DAW automatically downloads 30gb of samples once the Logic Pro X DAW is installed. Now, again there are many Sample packs on the web which would provide you high quality sounds for free </p>

<h2 class="second"> CONS </h2>
    

<div id="intro">
    
<p class="second"> The Mac Version of FL STUDIO is in Beta Version. So it wont run on Mac OSX. FL Studio is compatible with LINUX Whereas the Apple Logic X pro is only compatible with MAC OSX. FL studio is prone to crash, So you need to save your project before doing some major changes in your project. Apple Logic X pro has a really poor Audio Editor. You will never get the flexibility of Edison (FL STUDIOâ€™s Sound editor) in APPLE LOGIC PRO. Apple logic X pro does not support 32bit plugins and many good sounding free plugins are available in 32 bit format only. Considering that you have a mac: So, If you have a Mac, then keeping the above things in mind I would recommend you to Install Windows 10 on your Mac using BOOT CAMP and then installing Fl studio on it. This will give you the power of a mac and the awesomeness and flexibility of Fl studio. </p>
